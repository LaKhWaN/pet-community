# Active Context: Pet Community - Service CRUD Implementation

## 1. Current Focus

The focus has been on extending the service management functionality to include full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, specifically allowing users to modify and delete the services they created. This involved adding backend endpoints, creating new frontend modals for management, editing, and deletion confirmation, and integrating these into the existing workflow.

## 2. Recent Changes

*   **Backend:**
    *   Updated `Service` model (`backend/models/service.js`) to include a required `createdBy` field referencing the `User` model.
    *   Updated `serviceController.js` (`addService`) to store the `createdBy` user ID.
    *   Added new controller functions (`getMyServices`, `updateService`, `deleteService`).
    *   Updated `backend/routes/services.js` with new routes and corrected `authMiddleware` application (applied individually to each private route, fixing a potential `createdBy` error).
*   **Frontend:**
    *   Updated `Navbar.jsx` to include "Modify My Services" option and integrate `ManageServicesModal`. Fixed JSX syntax errors.
    *   Created `ManageServicesModal.jsx` which fetches the user's own services (`/api/services/my-services`), lists them, and includes buttons to trigger edit/delete actions.
    *   Created `EditServiceModal.jsx` as a form pre-filled with service data, handling PUT requests to update a service.
    *   Created `DeleteConfirmationModal.jsx` to confirm deletion before sending a DELETE request.
    *   Integrated `EditServiceModal` and `DeleteConfirmationModal` into `ManageServicesModal`.
    *   Integrated `ManageServicesModal` into `Navbar.jsx`.
    *   Updated `App.jsx` to include `handleServiceUpdated` and `handleServiceDeleted` callbacks to update the global `services` state upon modification or deletion, passing these handlers down to the `Navbar`.

## 3. Next Steps

*   **Testing:** Test the service CRUD workflow, especially adding services (to confirm `createdBy` fix) and accessing "Modify My Services" (to check token handling). Verify image `onError` handler behavior.
*   **Service Detail Page:** Implemented `ServiceDetail.jsx` to fetch service details from the backend API and display them. Handles loading and error states, and displays a "Service not found!" message if the service is not found.
*   **UI Refinements:** Improve loading/error states and visual feedback in modals. Polish UI.
*   **Backend Search/Filtering:** Implement server-side search/filtering for the main `/api/services` endpoint.
*   **Memory Bank:** Review and update all memory bank files for consistency after these changes.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

*   **Image Handling:** Still using URLs. Direct uploads remain a future consideration.
*   **State Management:** Global state in `App.jsx` now handles add, update, and delete operations, keeping the main service list consistent. This approach is functional but monitor for complexity.
*   **Filtering/Search:** Still client-side. Backend filtering needed.
*   **Authentication:** `authMiddleware` application corrected on backend routes. Frontend token handling via Axios interceptor appears correct but user reported issues accessing authenticated routes, suggesting potential token/login state problems to investigate during testing.
*   **Image Error Handling:** `onError` handler implemented in `Service.jsx` should prevent infinite loading for invalid image URLs.
