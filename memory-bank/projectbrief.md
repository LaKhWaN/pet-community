# Project Brief: Pet Community

## 1. Project Goal

## 2. Target Audience

This is a personal project, primarily for development and learning purposes.

## 3. Core Features

The application will include the following core features:

*   **User Authentication & Profiles:** Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles (settings, posted services, forum activity).
*   **Pet Services:**
    *   Browse and view available pet services.
    *   Search and filter services, potentially based on location.
    *   (Future/Implied) Users might be able to create, update, and delete their own service listings.
    *   Detailed view for each service.
*   **Community Forums:** A space for users to post topics, ask questions, and interact with other members of the community.
*   **Location-Based Filtering:** Ability to filter content (initially services) based on geographical location.

## 4. Scope
