# Progress: Pet Community - Service Management

## 1. What Works

- **Backend API:**
  - `/api/services` (GET): Successfully fetches all services from the MongoDB database.
  - `/api/services` (POST): Creates a new service associated with the logged-in user (`createdBy`). Requires auth (middleware applied correctly).
  - `/api/services/:id` (GET): Fetches a single service by ID.
  - `/api/services/my-services` (GET): Fetches services created by the logged-in user. Requires auth (middleware applied correctly).
  - `/api/services/:id` (PUT): Updates a service if the logged-in user is the creator. Requires auth (middleware applied correctly).
  - `/api/services/:id` (DELETE): Deletes a service if the logged-in user is the creator. Requires auth (middleware applied correctly).
- **Frontend:**
  - **Service Listing (`/services`):**
    - Fetches all public services from the backend API on load.
    - Displays fetched services in cards.
    - Shows loading/error states.
    - Updates list automatically when any service is added, updated, or deleted (via callbacks from modals propagated through `App.jsx`).
    - Basic client-side filtering works.
  - **Navbar:**
    - "Services" dropdown includes "Show Services", "Add Service" (logged-in only), and "Modify My Services" (logged-in only).
    - Triggers the correct modals (`AddServiceModal`, `ManageServicesModal`).
  - **Add Service Modal:**
    - Functional for creating new services.
    - Sends POST request, handles response/toasts, triggers `onServiceAdded` callback.
  - **Manage Services Modal:**
    - Opens via Navbar.
    - Fetches and lists services created by the logged-in user (`/api/services/my-services`).
    - Displays Edit and Delete buttons for each service.
    - Triggers `EditServiceModal` or `DeleteConfirmationModal` on button clicks.
  - **Edit Service Modal:**
    - Opens with pre-filled data for the selected service.
    - Sends PUT request on save, handles response/toasts, triggers `onUpdateSuccess` callback.
    - Sends DELETE request on confirmation, handles response/toasts, triggers `onDeleteSuccess` callback.
  - **Routing:** Links from service cards to detail page work.
  - **404 Page:** A 404 page has been implemented using a new `NotFound.jsx` component and a catch-all route in `App.jsx`.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Implement

- **Service Detail Page (`ServiceDetail.jsx`):** Implemented to fetch and display service details from the backend API.
- **Backend Search/Filtering:** Still client-side filtering on the main list. Backend filtering needed for scalability.
- **Image Handling:** Still URL-based.
- **UI/UX Refinements:**
  - Improve form validation in Add/Edit modals.
  - Improve loading/error states within all modals.
  - Add visual feedback (e.g., button disabling) during API calls in modals.
  - Consider pagination for the main service list and potentially the "Manage My Services" list.

## 3. Current Status

Full CRUD functionality for user-owned services is implemented via modals accessible from the Navbar. Users can add, view all, view their own, edit their own, and delete their own services. Backend routes are protected by authentication and include ownership checks. The main service list updates dynamically based on these actions. The Service Detail page is now implemented to display service details fetched from the backend.

## 4. Known Issues / Bugs

- **Scalability:** Client-side filtering on the main services page remains an issue for large datasets.
- **Image Validation:** Still relies on basic URL format validation and frontend `onError` fallback.
- **Testing:** Currently testing adding a new service to confirm the `createdBy` fix. Will then test accessing "Modify My Services" and image loading.
